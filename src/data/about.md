# Currently

At the University of Florida, I have learned how to work with teams, create innovative solutions, program effectively, and build on-line web applications with technologies like [JavaScript](/resume#skills), [React](resume#skills), [HTML](resume#skills), and [CSS](resume#skills). I am excited to say I will be graduating in the May of 2023.

# Some history

- At 16, I became fascinated with upcoming technologies and businesses. I would spend hours reading articles and watching videos about entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.

- At 18, I found a passion for building and flying first person view racing drones. I didn't know it at the time but this would be the beginning of my interest in computers.

- At 19, I got accepted into my dream school, University of Florida.

- At 20, I took my first programming class, Fundamentals of Programming I. This class solidified my passion for computer science.

- At 21, I got accepted in [Amazon's](https://amazon.com) Internship program where I spent the summer in Spokane, Washington. During my time there, I created a JavaScript program for mangers that automatically calculated shift critical operation values. I then coordinated with system engineers to launch the program officially to 77 fulfillment centers across North America.

- In the Fall, I was hired as a part-time software developer for a government contracting company, [Emerging Tech](https://emergingtech.co). Here I was able to apply my software development skills with team of developers for the first time. This position gave me the knowledge and confidence I needed to finally create my own website development business.
