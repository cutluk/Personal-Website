# Intro

As a self employed front-end software engineer, I believe in providing excellent customer service through my work and communication. I love being a part of impactfull projects that help make peoples lives easier. If you are interested in meeting me, please feel free to get in [touch](mailto:Luke.E.Cutting@gmail.com).

# Currently

I've had the opportuninty to create [professional websites](projects) for multiple busineses, as well as work with professional development teams creating enterprise level React applications. This has propelled my experience in React and other web-develement technologies further than I could've ever believed. I have become an expert in cutting-edge technologies such as [JavaScript](/resume#skills), [React](resume#skills), [HTML](resume#skills), and [CSS](resume#skills).
# 
In addition to my software development expertise, I also have experience in computer networking. I was responsible for planning, building, and configuring a company network from the ground up. This involved designing and implementing various network components such as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), a VPN gateway, and firewalls. I worked closely with other IT professionals to ensure that the network was secure, reliable, and scalable.

# Some history

- At 16, I became fascinated with upcoming technologies and businesses. I would spend hours reading articles and watching videos about entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.

- At 18, I found a passion for building and flying first person view racing drones. I didn't know it at the time but this would be the beginning of my interest in computers.

- At 19, I got accepted into my dream school, University of Florida.

- At 20, I took my first programming class, Fundamentals of Programming I. This class solidified my passion for computer science.

- At 21, I got accepted in [Amazon's](https://amazon.com) Internship program where I spent the summer in Spokane, Washington. During my time there, I created a JavaScript program for mangers that automatically calculated shift critical operation values. I then coordinated with system engineers to launch the program officially to 77 fulfillment centers across North America.

- At 21, I was hired as a part-time software developer for a government contracting company, [Emerging Tech](https://emergingtech.co). Here I was able to apply my software development skills with team of developers for the first time. This position gave me the knowledge and confidence I needed to finally create my own website development business.

- At 22, I decided to take the leap of faith and become a full-time freelance developer. It was nerve-racking at first, however, the opportunity to be my own boss and ability work on many different impactfull projects was too appealing. So far I have had the pleasure to work with some amazing people on some amazing projects.
